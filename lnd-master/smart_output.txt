🎯 SMART PREDICTION Summary: 10/10 successful decryptions (100.0%)

================================================================================
📊 LIGHTNING MESSAGE ANALYSIS SUMMARY
================================================================================

🔍 Processing 10 decrypted messages...

📈 DECRYPTION RESULTS:
   ✅ Successfully decrypted: 10/10 packets (100.0%)
   ❌ Failed to decrypt: 0 packets

💡 KEY FINDINGS:
   🔑 All successfully decrypted packets appear to be Lightning protocol
   📦 Mix of message types including HTLC operations and channel management
   💸 Payment flow detected: update_add_htlc → update_fulfill_htlc
   🔄 Multiple commitment/revocation cycles observed

⚠️  ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
   🚨 Some 2-byte messages show invalid Lightning message types
   🔍 These may be incorrectly decrypted fragments or noise
   📝 Message types like 0x05b3, 0x00a4, 0x0063 are not valid Lightning types

🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1. Filter out 2-byte messages with invalid types (likely noise)
   2. Focus analysis on messages with valid Lightning types (128, 130, 132, 133, etc.)
   3. Payment flow is correctly identified and working
   4. Consider expanding nonce range if more packets fail to decrypt

================================================================================
